# HG-Bishop-Daniel Website JS
Hello, if you're seeing this, then it's likely possible that I'm no longer working on this repository.

This readme will outline how the JS code works.

## Functionality

### Launching the Javascript
In testing, the code can be hosted locally on http://localhost:3000/index.js via

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Compiling and using
In order to compile and use the javascript, simply run:
```bash
pnpm build
```

This will export the JS into a build folder, where it can be pasted into a script tag or hosted in a CDN
